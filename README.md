## Ben Jakubowski and Mike Higgins

In 2016, the NYC Department of Education released a Call for Innovations requesting submission of predictive models that gave MSE-minimizing predictions of the number of students in each grade K-5, for each census tract in School District 20, for each year from 2011-12 to 2015-2016. We report on development of two types of probabilistic graphical models developed for this predictive task. Both models are premised on the hypothesis that priors which induce spatial smoothness could help reduce overfitting and yield better predictive models. Unfortunately, this core hypothesis was not supported by our experiments. Regardless, we report our results, provide potential explanations, and suggest alternative approaches.

The full report is provided in Inference_project_IEEE.pdf. Note data and HMCMC samples have not been included in this repo for reasons of confidentiality and space, respectively.
